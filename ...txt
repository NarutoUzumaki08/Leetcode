I was first orange-pilled by my friends Anmol Sharma and Vaibhav Dixit and ever since, 
for the past few months I have been going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. 
I was really fascinated by the concepts and technologies that form the basis of Bitcoin ecosystem.
I want to dive deeper into the Bitcoin rabbit hole. The summer of bitcoin internship program will truly be an 
amazing learning experience for me where I'll be mentored by highly skilled bitcoin developers and learn directly from them
I'll be able to contribute to Bitcoin ecosystem and have direct impact on its users, which is not possible in any other open 
source programs. I greatly admire Phil Zimmerman and like him I want to leave my mark upon the world 
and I believe contributing to Bitcoin will help me do that.
